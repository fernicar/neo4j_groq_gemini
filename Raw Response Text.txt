Okay, let's see. The user wants me to process these triplets and output them in a specific format first, then create a story. The triplets are (Alice, lives_in, Wonderland), (Alice, met, White Rabbit), and (White Rabbit, is_a, Animal). I need to make sure I list them exactly as given, each on a new line in markdown. Then I have to put ###END_TRIPLETS### after that.

Now, the story part needs to include all these facts. So Alice lives in Wonderland, she meets the White Rabbit, and the White Rabbit is an animal. I should start with Alice living in Wonderland. Maybe she's curious. Then, she meets the White Rabbit. Since it's an animal, perhaps it's a talking rabbit or acts in an animal-like way. Maybe the White Rabbit is hopping around or has some role in Wonderland. I should make sure the story flows naturally and includes all three points without adding extra info. Need to check that "is_a Animal" is properly represented, so maybe describe the White Rabbit as an animal. Alright, let me structure that into a short story. Make sure the output is in the correct format with the markdown and text blocks. Wait, the user specified the story should be between ```text and ```, so I need to use that. Let me double-check the instructions. Yep, first the triplets in markdown, then ###END_TRIPLETS###, then the story in text. Got it. Alright, time to put it all together.

```markdown
(Alice, lives_in, Wonderland)
(Alice, met, White Rabbit)
(White Rabbit, is_a, Animal)
###END_TRIPLETS###
```text
Alice lived in the curious land of Wonderland, where nothing was quite as it seemed. One sunny afternoon, while exploring the meadows of flowers that sang lullabies, she spotted a White Rabbit rushing by. Unlike any ordinary hare, this rabbit wore a waistcoat and checked pocket watch, fretting about being late. Alice, ever inquisitive, followed it as it darted down a burrow. The White Rabbit, being a rather harried animal, didn’t even notice the girl trailing behind—a peculiar encounter that led Alice deeper into Wonderland’s enchanted heart.
