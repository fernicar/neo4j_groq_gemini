You must re-state these exact facts in the specified output format and then write a natural language story that fully incorporates these facts. Ensure the output strictly follows the specified format, including markers and separator.
query = Process the following triplets: {triplets_input}. First output the triplets in the format described by {triplet_format_desc} between {triplet_start_marker} and {triplet_end_marker}. Then add {separator}. Then write a story based on these facts between {story_start_marker} and {story_end_marker}.
